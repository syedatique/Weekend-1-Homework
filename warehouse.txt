# Warehouse Picker

We need an application to handle the picking of items from a warehouse distribution centre.

Our warehouse has three rows of racking (racks 'a, 'b', and 'c') located around a central loading bay where the fork-lift trucks maneuver - no pedestrians allowed!

Each row of racking has ten bays (numbered 1 to 10). The racks are arranged in a "U" shape, with the warehouse-pickers' entrance to the warehouse by rack 'a', bay '10', and the exit by rack 'b', bay '10'.

Here's an ASCII-art illustration to help visualize (but you must've been to a Scandinavian furniture store... you know how it looks):

```
>     c1 c2 c3 c4 c5 c6 c7 c8 c9 c10
>
> a1    __________________________   b1
> a2   |                         |   b2
> a3   |                         |   b3
> a4   | Loading bay...          |   b4
> a5   |                         |   b5
> a6   |                         |   b6
> a7   | Can't walk here.        |   b7
> a8   |                         |   b8
> a9   |                         |   b9
> a10  |                         |   b10
>
> >> entrance                     >> exit
```

Our inventory is distributed amongst the bays, in no particular order.

Product       | Bay
--------------|----
bath fizzers  | b7
blouse        | a3
bookmark      | a7
candy wrapper | c8
chalk         | c3
cookie jar    | b10
deodorant     | b9
drill press   | c2
face wash     | c6
glow stick    | a9
hanger        | a4
leg warmers   | c10
model car     | a8
nail filer    | b5
needle        | a1
paint brush   | c7
photo album   | b4
picture frame | b3
rubber band   | a10
rubber duck   | a5
rusty nail    | c1
sharpie       | b2
shoe lace     | c9
shovel        | a6
stop sign     | a2
thermometer   | c5
tire swing    | b1
tissue box    | b8
tooth paste   | b6
word search   | c4

Your job is to produce an app that does two things:

1) Given a list of bays, list the items in those bays, and calculate the distance from the two furthest apart bays. For instance:

  - given "b5, b10, and b6", determine that the products are "nail filer, cookie jar, and tooth paste", and they're five bays apart
  - given "b3, c7, c9 and a3", determine that the products are "picture frame, paint brush, shoe lace, and blouse", and they're 15 bays apart.)

2) Given a list of products, find the bays that need to be visited, and order them in the order they need to be visited from entrance to exit. For instance:

  - given "shoe lace, rusty nail, leg warmers", determine that those items need to be collected from "c1, c9, and c10"
  - given "hanger, deodorant, candy wrapper, rubber band", determine that those items need to be collected from "a10, a4, c8, and b9"


## Further considerations

Imagine that our warehouse had another rack built, opposite rack 'c', so now our warehouse forms a circular route. How would this impact the calculation of ordering the pick-list routes, and the distances between any two given bays? What amount of changes would you need to make to your solution to support this new requirement?
